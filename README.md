## 📌 Overview

This Node.js project simulates a fake Instagram login page to demonstrate how phishing attacks work.  
When a user clicks the **Sign In** button, they are redirected to another page that says:

# You are phished!

This is meant to teach people to recognize suspicious login pages and be cautious when entering credentials.
